# ETL-Movies
## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to take data from three CSV files that were imported from the internet and convert them in dataframes.
Once the dataframe was created from the CSV files, the data in these dataframes had to be cleaned then and once they were clean the dataframes 
were merged with each other. The remaining dataframes were imported to a SQL database where they were cleaned one more time.
