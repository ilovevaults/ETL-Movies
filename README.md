# ETL-Movies
## Goals
The goal of this analysis was to go through the steps of ETL. Data from three CSV files of movies were imported from the internet and converted them in dataframes.
Once the dataframe was created from the CSV files, the data in these dataframes had to be cleaned. Once they were clean the dataframes were merged with each other. The remaining dataframes were imported to a SQL database where they were cleaned one more time.
